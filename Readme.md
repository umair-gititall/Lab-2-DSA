# LAB-2-DSA  

## Overview  
This repository contains solutions for **Lab 2 - Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. The lab focuses on **abstract classes, pure virtual functions, templates, and OOP concepts**.  

## Folder Structure  

### Home Tasks  
The **Home Tasks** folder contains solutions to tasks given in the provided PDF. Please refer to the PDF for problem statements.  

- **Task_1.cpp & Task_1.h** → Implements an abstract class `Shape` with pure virtual function `area()`, and derived classes `Circle` and `Rectangle`.  
- **Task_2.cpp & Task_2.h** → Implements an abstract class `Employee` with pure virtual function `calculateSalary()`, and derived classes `FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee`.  
- **Task_3.cpp & Task_3.h** → Implements a **Library System** using **templates** and **OOP principles**, featuring **Books & Newspapers**, with searching and sorting functionalities.  

### Lab Tasks  
These tasks are separate from the **Home Tasks** and focus on searching and sorting algorithms.  

- **Binary Search.cpp** → Implements the **Binary Search algorithm** on a sorted array.  
- **Bubble Sort Actual Meaning.cpp** → Provides a conceptual explanation of **Bubble Sort** along with its implementation.  
- **Bubble Sort.cpp** → Implements the standard **Bubble Sort algorithm** for sorting an array.  
- **Classes.cpp** → Demonstrates **OOP concepts**, including **inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation**.  
- **Linear Search.cpp** → Implements the **Linear Search algorithm** to find an element in an array.  
- **Pair Finding.cpp** → Implements a solution to **find pairs** in an array based on a given condition.
